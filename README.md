| Indicator         | Rating "Worst"                                                           | Rating "Best"                                                                                          |
|:------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Teamwork          | I don't like working with these people.                                  | We are a great, close-knit team!                                                                       |
| Fun               | Boredom.                                                                 | I love going to work and spending time together!                                                       |
| Help from other   | It's easier to do everything yourself than to ask someone else for help. | The guys from my team are very responsive and will always come to the rescue.                          |
| Team Mission      | We have no idea why we work here, our mission is unclear.                | We know exactly what we are here for, and we are very happy about it!                                  |
| Quality           | Our quality is a complete disappointment.                                | We are proud of what we do! The code is clean, the tests are clear, the documentation is easy to find! |
| Speed             | It seems like it will never end. Constant blockers!                      | Everything is done very quickly, without delays!                                                       |
| Processes in team | It's unpleasant, a lot of manual work that takes forever.                | Simple, fast and mostly automated.                                                                     |
| Learning          | We never have time to learn anything!                                    | We are constantly learning new things!                                                                 |
| Decision Making   | We are just cogs in the project, we don’t decide anything.               | We decide what to do and how to do it better!                                                          |
| Product Value     | I'm ashamed of this product.                                             | We make a great product and take pride in what we do!                                                  |
